# Netgear Nighthawk WiFi Extender gutted 
# for Raspberry Pi Zero2W installed(this write up is WIP)

## Introduction

In this project, I transformed a Netgear Nighthawk WiFi extender into a compact and versatile device by integrating a Raspberry Pi Zero2W running PiTail Kali. The goal was to repurpose existing hardware and create a custom solution for network analysis and WiFi management.

## Materials and Tools

- **Netgear Nighthawk WiFi Extender**
- **Raspberry Pi Zero2W**
- **PiTail Kali OS**
- **Old 1A iPhone Charger**
- **Micro USB to USB A Adapter**
- **Soldering Kit**
- **Hot Glue Gun**
- **Basic Hand Tools**

## Steps

### 1. Disassembly of the WiFi Extender

- Carefully disassemble the Netgear Nighthawk WiFi extender. Remove all internal components, keeping only the outer case for the repurposing process.

### 2. Preparation of the Raspberry Pi Zero2W

- Install PiTail Kali OS on the Raspberry Pi Zero2W. Ensure that all necessary drivers and configurations are in place for optimal performance.

### 3. Modifying the iPhone Charger

- I cut open the 1 amp iPhone charger leaving 90% intact only removing one side.
- I then soldered the leads to the outlet prongs. 
- Secure the soldered connections with hot glue to ensure durability and safety.
 This will be used to power the Raspberry Pi safely.
### 4. Integration into the Extender Case

- Place the Raspberry Pi Zero2W into the now-empty WiFi extender case. Position it carefully to maximize space and airflow.
- Cut a slot into the side of the case for the micro USB to USB A adapter. This modification looks nearly factory and provides a secure connection for external peripherals.

### 5. Assembly

- Reassemble the WiFi extender case with the Raspberry Pi Zero2W and power setup inside. The case should now be a functional enclosure for the new device.
- Ensure all components are firmly secured and that there’s no risk of short circuits.

### 6. Testing

- Power up the modified WiFi extender and verify that the Raspberry Pi Zero2W boots correctly and operates as expected.
- Test connectivity and functionality of PiTail Kali to confirm that it’s working correctly in the new setup.

## Final Touches

The end result is a compact, portable device that leverages the existing WiFi extender case to house and protect the Raspberry Pi Zero2W. The integration of the old iPhone charger and the USB adapter maintains a clean and professional appearance while enhancing the functionality of the original hardware.
